# Crime in Los Angeles: A Data-Driven Investigation
Los Angeles is a city of lights, glamour, and… crime. But when do most crimes occur? Which areas are the most dangerous at night? Who are the most common victims? This project dives deep into crime data to uncover patterns hidden beneath the surface.

## What This Project Does
Using real crime data, this analysis explores:

## The most dangerous hour in LA – What time do most crimes happen?
  - The riskiest area at night – Which neighborhoods see the most crime between 10 PM and 4 AM?
  - Who is most affected? – Breaking down crime by victim age groups to see who is most at risk.

## How It Works
  - The dataset (crimes.csv) contains information on thousands of reported crimes, including the time, location, and details about the victims.
  - Using Python and powerful data tools, we analyze crime frequency, identify patterns, and visualize insights with stunning charts.

## Tech Behind the Analysis
  This project runs on:

  1. Python for data processing
  2. Pandas & NumPy for handling large datasets
  3. Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization
  4. Data Science techniques to extract meaningful insights

## See It in Action
Bar charts, heatmaps, and graphs bring this data to life—making crime trends in LA more than just numbers.

## How to Run It
  - Install Python and required libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).
  - Place crimes.csv in the project folder.
  - Run the script and watch the insights unfold.
    
## What’s Next?
  - Exploring seasonal crime trends—does crime spike in summer?
  - Predicting future crime hotspots using machine learning.
  - Investigating whether certain crime types follow specific patterns.
  - Crime data tells a story. This project deciphers it.
